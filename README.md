This is a [Botium](https://github.com/codeforequity-at/botium-core) connector for testing your Facebook Messenger chatbot.

__Did you read the [Botium in a Nutshell](https://medium.com/@floriantreml/botium-in-a-nutshell-part-1-overview-f8d0ceaf8fb4) articles ? Be warned, without prior knowledge of Botium you won't be able to properly use this library!__

## How it worksÂ ?
Botium uses two technologies for driving the conversations against your chatbot.

For __Sending Messages__ the great [facebook-chat-api](https://github.com/Schmavery/facebook-chat-api) library is used - it mimicks the behaviour of a browser to login to Facebook and sending a text messages to your chatbot.

For __Receiving Messages__ it's a bit more tricky: we register a special webhook as "Secondary Receiver" at the Facebook Page to receive all your chatbot's input and output messages. The "Secondary Receiver" concept is part of the [handover protocol](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/handover-protocol/): it allows additional webhooks to be registered in "standby" mode, and this is what Botium does.

__Redis__ is used to connect the webhook to Botium scripts: all messages received over the webhook are published to Redis, and Botium on the other end subscribes to those Redis channels before running a conversation. 

It can be used as any other Botium connector with all Botium Stack components:
* [Botium CLI](https://github.com/codeforequity-at/botium-cli/)
* [Botium Bindings](https://github.com/codeforequity-at/botium-bindings/)
* [Botium Box](https://www.botium.at)

## Requirements

* __Node.js and NPM__
* a __Facebook Messenger__ chatbot, and a facebook developer account with administrative rights
* a __Redis__ instance (free tier for example from [redislabs](https://redislabs.com/) will do as a starter)
* a __project directory__ on your workstation to hold test cases and Botium configuration

## Install and Run the Botium webhook service

The Botium webhook service is running outside of Botium as a background service, as it has to be always-on - otherwise Facebook servers will quit transmitting messages to it.

Installation with NPM:

    > npm install -g botium-connector-fbpagereceiver
    > botium-fbproxy-cli start --help

There are several options required for running the Botium webhook service:

_--port_: Local port to listen

_--verifytoken_: Facebook Verification Token

_--accesstoken_: Facebook Page Access Token

_--appsecret_: Facebook App Secret for request verification (optional)

_--endpoint_: Webhook endpoint (url part after the port ...) (optional, default _/api/botium-connector-fbpagereceiver_)

_--redisurl_: Redis connection url

Obviously, you are already familiar with the Facebook developer console to register a webhook, so you already know where to get those tokens and secrets - otherwise, start to learn [here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/webhook/)

Botium is providing the service, but you have to take care for connectivity and process management yourself:
* If your server is not reachable from the internet, consider to use a service like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) for publishing your endpoint - __Attentions: Facebook accepts HTTPS secured endpoints only!__
* For process management, logging, monitoring we recommend to use [pm2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io)

## Register Botium webhook service as "Secondary Receiver"

Here are the steps how to register the Botium webhook service as a Secondary Receiver:

1. In the [Facebook developer console](https://developers.facebook.com/) create a new Facebook App, and call it something like _MyChatbot Botium Standby App_
2. Add products _Messenger_ and _Webhooks_ to the app
3. In _Messenger_ section, create a page access key for the page your chatbot is connected to. 
4. Using this page access key, you can now start the Botium webhook service (with _--accesstoken_ parameter)
5. Register the Botium webhook service as Facebook webhook
    1. The webhook url is something like _https://your-public-ip/api/botium-connector-fbpagereceiver_
    2. The _verification token_ has to be the same as handed to the Botium webhook service (with _--verifytoken_ parameter)
    3. Events to subscribe to: messages, messaging_postbacks, message_echoes, standby
6. Now navigate to the Facebook page the chatbot is connected to and open the page settings, section _Messenger Platform_
7. In the _Subscribed Apps_ section, make sure that the actual chatbot app has the role _Primary Receiver_ while the newly created app has the role _Secondary Receiver_.

## Install Botium and Facebook Connector

When using __Botium CLI__:

```
> npm install -g botium-cli
> npm install -g botium-connector-fbpagereceiver
> botium-cli init
> botium-cli run
```

When using __Botium Bindings__:

```
> npm install -g botium-bindings
> npm install -g botium-connector-fbpagereceiver
> botium-bindings init mocha
> npm install && npm run mocha
```

When using __Botium Box__:

_Already integrated into Botium Box, no setup required_

## Connecting your Facebook Messenger Chatbot to Botium

Open the file _botium.json_ in your working directory and add the Facebook credentials and Redis connection settings.

```
{
  "botium": {
    "Capabilities": {
      "PROJECTNAME": "<whatever>",
      "CONTAINERMODE": "fbpagereceiver",
      "FBPAGERECEIVER_PAGEID": "...",
      "FBPAGERECEIVER_TESTUSER": "...",
      "FBPAGERECEIVER_TESTPASSWORD": "...",
      "FBPAGERECEIVER_TESTUSER_FULLNAME": "...",
      "FBPAGERECEIVER_REDISURL": "redis://127.0.0.1:6379"
    }
  }
}
```
Botium setup is ready, you can begin to write your [BotiumScript](https://github.com/codeforequity-at/botium-core/wiki/Botium-Scripting) files.

__Important: The Botium webhook service has to be running when Botium is started. Otherwise, Botium scripts will fail to receive any input or output messages from your chatbot!__

## Supported Capabilities

Set the capability __CONTAINERMODE__ to __fbpagereceiver__ to activate this connector.

### FBPAGERECEIVER_PAGEID
Facebook Page ID the chatbot is linked to (Facebook Page -> About -> More Info -> Page ID)

### FBPAGERECEIVER_TESTUSER
Facebook test user to run the conversations

### FBPAGERECEIVER_TESTPASSWORD
Facebook test user password

### FBPAGERECEIVER_TESTUSER_FULLNAME
The full name of the above test user. This is required because the chatbot users and the facebook users are not linked in any way (they have different ids - "page scoped ids"), and Botium needs a way to tell what messages belong together. This is done by using the full name.

### FBPAGERECEIVER_ASKFORLOGINAPPROVAL
Set this capability to true to bring up an input prompt if facebook asks for login approval. This may happen if logged in from a new location or from a cloud server.

### FBPAGERECEIVER_REDISURL
The url of your Redis instance - for example _redis://127.0.0.1:6379_.

Or a Redis options object - see [here](https://github.com/luin/ioredis#connect-to-redis)

## Open Issues and Restrictions

* Quick Reply buttons are not delivered to the Secondary Receiver webhook, so Botium won't receive it. It will receive cards and pictures though.
